<h2>Here are some players on the up come:</h2>
<p>There are many players you may want to take into consideration, players that you may pick up off of waivers, players you can try to trade for,<br>
 who are replacing star, first-line forwards who are injured. The reason you may want these players is because if they were second line center,<br>
 and a first line center was injured, they would move up to first line replacing him which would result in more ice-time.</p>

<h3>Player #1: Tyler Johnson (C), Tampa Bay Lightning</h3>

<p>Recently, NHL star Steven Stamkos, was awkwardly hit into the boards, and obtained a right knee injury. Seeing that he is a first line centerman<br>
 with young star Nikita Kucherov, the second line center Tyler Johnson is most likely to move up a line going from second to first.</p>
<br>
<h3>Player #2: Kevin Hayes (C), New York Rangers</h3>

<p>Kevin Hayes went from being third line center, to second line center. With the injury of former Ottawa Senators centerman, Mikka Zibanejad, he was promoted to second line.<br>
Seeing that New York is currently the top scoring team, with the highest differential, he will be a great fantasy player.</p>
<h3>Player #3:  (C), New York Rangers</h3>
