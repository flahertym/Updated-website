<h1 style="font-size:500%"> <center>NHL Fantasy</center> </h1>

<center>
<h2>Here are some players on the up come:</h2>
<p>There are many players you may want to take into consideration, players that you may pick up off of waivers, players you can try to trade for,<br>
 who are replacing star, first-line forwards who are injured. The reason you may want these players is because if they were second line center,<br>
 and a first line center was injured, they would move up to first line replacing him which would result in more ice-time.</p>

<h3>Player #1: Tyler Johnson (C), Tampa Bay Lightning</h3>
<img src="http://www.tampabay.com/resources/images/dti/rendered/2015/01/c4s_lite012715_14478322_8col.jpg" alt="TylerJohnson.png" style="width:450px;height:300px;">
<p>Recently, NHL star Steven Stamkos, was awkwardly hit into the boards, and obtained a right knee injury. Seeing that he is a first line centerman<br>
 with young star Nikita Kucherov, the second line center Tyler Johnson is most likely to move up a line going from second to first.</p>
<br>
<h3>Player #2: Kevin Hayes (C), New York Rangers</h3>
<img src="http://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.10101343.1427073209!/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/display_600/image.JPG" style="width:573px;height:400px;">
<p>Kevin Hayes went from being third line center, to second line center. With the injury of former Ottawa Senators centerman, Mikka Zibanejad, he was promoted to second line.<br>
Seeing that New York is currently the top scoring team, with the highest differential, he will be a great fantasy player.</p>
<h3>Player #3: Mitchell Marner (RW), Toronto Maple Leafs</h3>
<img src="http://cdn3-www.hockeysfuture.com/assets/uploads/2015/06/mitch_marner_toronto_062615.jpg" style="width:580px;height:387px;">
<p>The young rookie, Mitchell Marner, was moved to first line right wing, accompanied by centerman, Tyler Bozak, and left wing, James<br>
Van Riemsdyk. Marner started off the season being a winger with second overall draft pick, Auston Matthews, but then was moved to first line<br>
with Van Riemsdyk and Bozak where they found a connection. Marner has 18 points in 21 games played. This is amazing considering Toronto isn't<br>
known for being a goal scoring team, and the fact that he is a rookie (not too popular), means that he is not owned by many fantasy players.</p> 
<h3>Player #4: Antoine Roussel (LW), Dallas Stars</h3>
<img src="http://3951-presscdn-28-25.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Antoine-Roussel.jpg" style="width:500px;height:350px;">
<p>Even though left winger Antoine Roussel is putting up points, avoid picking him up from waivers or drafting him. He is the current NHL leader<br>
for penalties in minutes, with 70. Keep in mind this is in just 25 games!
